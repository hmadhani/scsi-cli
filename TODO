		SCSI-CLI Command Line Utility
		-----------------------------

Here's list of TO-Do items that can be improved in the future release

1. Improve Device Path checking
	i.e. before trying to open the device path check if there are any
	entries present. This would speed up execution of the scsi-cli
	output in case no devices are found
	For Example,
	1. FCP Devices: Check /sys/class/fc_host/ Directory path
	   if /sys/class/fc_host/ has 0 entries that means that there are no FC
	   host configured. meaning, system might have adapter installed but
	   driver module is not loaded and configured.
	2. Enclosure: If /sys/class/enclosure/ path does not exists means
	   there are no enclosure devices present in the system
	3. iSCSI: check /sys/class/iscsi_host has any entries. if there are 0
	   entries indicate system does not have iscsi configured
	4. Md/DM device: check /sys/class/
	5. SAS devices: Check /sys/class/sas_host/ directory. If there are 0
	   entries indicate there are no SAS controller or device present.

2. Add support for SAS/Tape/CD-Rom Device.

3. Fully support following comands before next beta release
	1. Alias capability for renaming devices to custom names.
	2. Display Error counts for disk/FCP/iSCSI  devices
	3. Take device Online and Offline
	4. Issue Reset to a give device
	5. Issue Full scan of the transport

4. For disk Offline option, Check to make sure we are not disabling boot device.
   Disabling boot device can result into unpredictable and unreachable system.

5. Add more checks for various device path for tool's stablility.

6. Find a way to get HCTL values without using sscanf().
	Currently SCSI devices creates sysfs diretory structure

	# ls /sys/block/sda/device/scsi_device/
	9:0:0:0

	Here the format represents "host:bus:target:lun". In order to read this
	values in one shot, sscanf() is used. However, sscanf() is considered
	unsecure coding standard. This code needs to be investigated for a
	better solution to prevent usage of sscanf().

7. Add user-friendly bash-completion logic. This would allow user to list all
  supported commands with a tab style completion.

8. Look into ways to scale this tool for a very large system.
   (For example, a large configuration with
       - list out 1000s of disk attached to the system,
       - list out 100s of iSCSI connections,
       - list out 10s-100s of FC adapters each with 100s of LUNs attached)
